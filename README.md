# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to assist Dana, a data journalist, who is writing about UFO sightings to display the data that she has in an html webpage in a way that is easy to understand. We will leverage a table and filters to display the information about UFO sightings and allow the site visitor to filter for the information they are looking for.
## Results
The webpage allows for users to filter with 5 different filtering options by typing in the criteria to filter by. The user does not have to input a filter for all the criteria and can only filter by one or multiple filters. The filter tells the user what the category they need to input is and has a text box for them to enter as shown below:

When they enter the fields they want to filter by and press enter the table will be automatically updated with the filtered data. Below I have done 3 filters with the date (1/1/2010), city(el cajon) and country(us) as seen below:

By keeping the filter more broad there are higher number of items returned. By entering too many filters it is possible that no data will show up as there were no UFO sightings with those criteria.
## Summary
### Drawback
The user will not know what the filter options are for each filter category unless they go through the whole dataset. For example, the user might not know until what year there is data available unless they scroll through the whole table which is what the filters are meant to allow the user not to do.
### Recommendations
To improve this webpage there are a few things that can be done to enhance. Firstly, there can be a dropdown menu for each filter category that will let the user know what options are available to filter by. The second is to put back the filter button so the user will know that by pressing the button the filter will take place and they will not have to rely on knowing to press enter.

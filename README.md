# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to assist Dana, a data journalist, who is writing about UFO sightings to display the data that she has in an html webpage in a way that is easy to understand. We will leverage a table and filters to display the information about UFO sightings and allow the site visitor to filter for the information they are looking for.
## Results

The user does not have to input a filter for all the criteria but will need to filter by a minimum of 2. The filter tells the user what the category they need to input is and has a text box for them to enter as shown below:
